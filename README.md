# Linnerud-Linear-Regression
## Linnerud Dataset Machine Learning Project Using Linear Regression
This project explores the Linnerud dataset using Linear Regression, a machine learning model, to predict health-related metrics based on physical exercise data. The dataset contains exercise-related features (chin-ups, sit-ups, and jumps) and health targets (weight, waist circumference, and pulse).

## Project Overview
Dataset: The Linnerud dataset is used to analyze physical exercise performance and predict health metrics.
Machine Learning Model: Linear regression is applied to predict health outcomes based on exercise data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and correlations are analyzed to understand the relationships between exercise variables and health targets.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R2 score.
